## What is DataSciensPro?
DataSciensPro is an innovative educational solution designed to empower students to engage with real-world global challenges through hands-on learning and data-driven problem-solving. The project aligns with four key **United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (UNSDGs)**:

- **Climate Action**
- **Good Health and Well-Being**
- **Sustainable Cities and Communities**
- **Zero Hunger**

DataSciensPro enables students to **collect, analyze, and interpret** environmental and health-related data in real-time. The platform integrates a software interface with tools for **data visualization**, allowing students to understand complex problems and develop solutions using **data science and technology**.

## Updates

| **Release** | **Summary** |
|-------------|-------------|
| [DSPRO v2.0.0.1](https://nimble.li/k96ynpnd) | Wireless Configuration using Wi-Fi and Bluetooth Capabilities |
| [DSPRO v1.0.0.2](https://nimble.li/wdjavq6d) | PuTTY based Data Collection, DSPRO Configuration Tool & DSPRO Uninstall Process (DUP) |
| [DSPRO v1.0.0.1](https://nimble.li/a98wbyl9) | Initial release of DataSciensPro with core features. |

## Key Features
- **Hands-On Sensor Integration**: Students interact with a range of sensors to collect data on environmental and health-related parameters. 
- **DSPRO Software**: The user-friendly software guides students through the entire processâ€”from **sensor configuration and firmware upload** to **real-time data collection, cleaning, and visualization**. The platform also integrates a **plot area for customizable charts** (line, bar, pie) and **Power BI for advanced dashboard creation and analysis**.
- **UNSDG-Aligned Projects**: Focused on **problem-solving projects** related to the UNSDGs, encouraging students to address global issues like **climate change, health monitoring, sustainable urban living, and agriculture** through data science.
- **Automatic Data Management**: The software automates **data cleaning** and saves cleaned data as **CSV files**. Students can also manually clean data using **Power Query Editor in Excel**, fostering **data literacy skills**.
- **Visual Data Interpretation**: Built-in tools for **data visualization** using **DSPRO Software and Power BI** allow students to create and analyze **line charts, bar graphs, and pie charts**, gaining insights from their sensor data.

## Interactive Learning Experiments
DataSciensPro offers a series of **guided, hands-on experiments** that encourage students to explore **data-driven solutions for real-world problems**. Aligned with each **UNSDG goal**, these experiments allow students to **test hypotheses, collect data from sensors, and analyze findings**. The experiments foster **scientific inquiry** and **critical thinking**, providing practical insights into how **data science can be used to solve global challenges**.

## Learning Outcomes
- **Data Literacy**: Students develop a strong foundation in **data collection, cleaning, analysis, and visualization**. They learn how to work with **sensor-generated data**, structure it effectively, and interpret it to derive meaningful insights.
- **Critical Thinking & Problem Solving**: Through **UNSDG-aligned projects**, students learn to **analyze data critically** and propose **solutions to real-world challenges** such as climate change, health, urban sustainability, and agricultural optimization.
- **STEM Skills Development**: Students gain hands-on experience with **sensors, programming (Arduino), data analysis tools (Power BI), and data science techniques (Microsoft Excel)**â€”all essential for modern **STEM education**.
- **Global Awareness**: Students enhance their understanding of **global challenges** like climate change, public health, urbanization, and sustainable agriculture. This **instills a sense of global citizenship and social responsibility**, encouraging them to use their skills for **positive impact**.
